function showMessage() {
  // Defines a function named 'showMessage' that will be called when the button is clicked

  const message = document.getElementById("message");
  // Finds the HTML element with the ID "message" and stores a reference to it in the variable 'message'

  // Sets the text content of that element to a thank-you message
  // Note: The "ï¿½" symbol is most likely a placeholder for an unsupported or missing character.
  // You may want to replace it with a proper emoji like ðŸ˜Š or ðŸŽ‰
